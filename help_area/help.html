      Welcome to the help page for <span class="color-blue">Join</span>, your
      guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an
      overview of what <span class="color-blue">Join</span> is, how it can
      benefit you, and how to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="color-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management
      tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their
      web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br /><br />Kanban, a
      Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to
      visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
      <span class="color-blue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to
      help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
      interface.<br /><br />It is important to note that
      <span class="color-blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
      exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive
      to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee
      consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of
      quality regarding <span class="color-blue">Join</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
      <span class="color-blue">Join</span>:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Exploring the Board</h2>
    <p>
      When you log in to <span class="color-blue">Join</span>, you'll find a
      default board. This board represents your project and contains four
      default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
    </p>

    <h2>2. Creating Contacts in Join</h2>
    <p>
      You can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
      section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
      Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
      with the tasks on the board.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Adding Cards</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
      represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
      list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task
      name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Moving Cards</h2>
    <p>
      As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the
      board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Deleting Cards</h2>
    <p>
      Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
      delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
      Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
      irreversible. Remember that using
      <span class="color-blue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
      updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
      state of your project. Have more questions about
      <span class="color-blue">Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at
